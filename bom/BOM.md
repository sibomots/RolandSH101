# The Bill of Materials (BOM)

After looking over the board and schematic, I've made a near complete
BOM of the parts that are worth replacing.

There are (if I remember) three ICs that you will not find -- these
are Roland ICs. 

The rest of the parts as far as I can remember are listed below.

1.  [Resistors](./Resistors.md)
2.  [Caps](./Caps.md)
3.  [Transistors](./Transistors.md)
4.  [Diodes](./Diodes.md)
5.  [Bender-board Caps](./BenderCaps.md)
6.  [Bender-board Transistors](./BenderTr.md)


TODO:

This section needs work.


Go through the ICs.   All but three specimens on the board are easy
to get.  The main CPU can be found, except that you'd have to program it
and those tools plus the actual code to program it with is difficult to
get.  The other DIP-16/DIP-14, etc.. parts that are produced by Roland
will be impossible to get. (The package will have the icon).

The rest of the DIP-8 op-amps are actually easy to get and replace.
